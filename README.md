# advent_of_code

David's personal repo with solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I am using Python to solve the problems. Since 2023, I use chatGPT to *comment* (and only to comment) my code.
I do this by submitting my tested code (which passed validation from AoC) to chatGPT and ask for the comments.

I store solutions from different years as individual branches.
